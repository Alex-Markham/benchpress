For explanations of the parametrisations of each algorithm see the documentation for the corresponding algorithms.
Most of the parameters can be given as either a single value or a list.
However, some parametrers might be missing for some algorithms, to see which parameters are available please review the JSON schema.
Dots (.) in the original parameter names are omitted for implementational reasons.
