# Benchpress

![Benchpress](images/benchpress.jpg)

Benchpress is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow where structure learning algorithms, implemented in possibly different laguages, can be executed and compared.
The computations scale seamlessly on multiple cores or *"... to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition" - Snakemake*.
The documentation is found at https://benchpressdocs.readthedocs.io.

The currently supported algorithms are
- FGES (Tetrad)
- FCI (Tetrad)
- RFCI (Tetrad)
- GFCI (Tetrad)
- PC (pcalg)
- MMHC (bnlearn)
- HC (bnlearn)
- GS (bnlearn)
- Tabu (bnlearn)
- Inter-IAMB (bnlearn)
- ASOBS (r.blip)
- GOBNILP (GOBNILP C)
- No tears (jmoss20)
- Order MCMC (BiDAG)
- Iterative MCMC (BiDAG)
- PGibbs (trilearn)
- gg99_singlepair (A. Thomas)
- gt13_multipair (A. Thomas)
- gLasso (Scikit-learn)

## Reqirements
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([installation instructions](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) ([installation instructions](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/admin-guide/installation.html))
- Linux (Singularity currently only has a Beta release for OSX which is not enough)
## Installation

### Clone and install

`$ git clone https://github.com/felixleopoldo/benchpress.git`

#### Notes
On some systems, you might also have to explicitly install squash-tools. This can be done using conda as

`$ conda install -c conda-forge squash-tools`

## Usage

To run the simulation setup in [config/config_paper.json](config/config_paper.json) type

`$ snakemake --cores 20 --use-singularity --configfile config/config_paper.json`

A roc curve is found in the file [results/output/roc/FPRp_TRP_pattern.eps]() and can be viewed with e.g. evince as

`$ evince results/output/roc/FPRp_TRP_pattern.eps`
