# Benchpress

![Benchpress](images/benchpress.jpg)

A [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow for flexible and reproducible benchmarks of structure learning algorithms for graphical models.
The documentation is found here https://benchpressx.readthedocs.io.

## Reqirements
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/admin-guide/installation.html) ([installation instructions](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/admin-guide/installation.html))
- Linux/Unix (Singularity currently only has a Beta release for OSX which is not enough)
## Installation

### Cloning the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/felixleopoldo/benchpress.git && cd benchpress && pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Notes
On some systems, you might also have to explicitly install squash-tools. This can be done using conda as

`$ conda install -c conda-forge squash-tools`

## Usage

To run the simulation setup in config.json type

`$ snakemake roc --cores 20 --use-singularity --configfile config/config.sample.docs.json`

A roc curve defined by [config/config.sample.docs.json](config/config.sample.docs.json) is found in the file [results/ROC.eps]() and can be viewed with e.g. evince as

`$ evince results/ROC.eps`
