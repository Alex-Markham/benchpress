![Benchpress](images/benchpress.jpg)

Benchpress is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow where structure learning algorithms, implemented in possibly different laguages, can be executed and compared.
The computations scale seamlessly on multiple cores or *"... to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition" - Snakemake*.
The documentation is found at https://benchpressdocs.readthedocs.io.

The currently supported algorithms are tabulated below.
Acronyms are used for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Undirected Graphs (UGs), Decomposable Graphs (DGs), and Completed Partially DAGs (CPDAGs).

## Reqirements
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([installation instructions](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))
- [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) ([installation instructions](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/admin-guide/installation.html))
- Linux (Singularity currently only has a Beta release for OSX which is not enough)
## Installation

### Clone and install

`$ git clone https://github.com/felixleopoldo/benchpress.git`

#### Notes
On some systems, you might also have to explicitly install squash-tools. This can be done using conda as

`$ conda install -c conda-forge squash-tools`

## Usage

To run the simulation setup in [config/sec6.1.json](config/sec6.1.json) type

`$ snakemake --cores 20 --use-singularity --configfile config/sec6.1.json`

A roc curve is found in the file [results/output/roc/FPRp_TRP_pattern.eps]() and can be viewed with e.g. evince as

`$ evince results/output/roc/FPRp_TRP_pattern.eps`
