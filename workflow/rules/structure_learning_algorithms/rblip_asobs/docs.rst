A score-based two-phase algorithm where the first phase aims to identify the possible parent
sets, Scanagatta et al. (2015); Scanagatta, Corani, De Campos, and Zaffalon (2018). The
second phase performs an optimisation on a modification of the space of node orders introduced
in Teyssier and Koller (2012), allowing edges from nodes of higher to lower order, provided
that no cycles are introduced.
